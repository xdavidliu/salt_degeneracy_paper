background

1) what SALT is
2) degenerate solution in ring known, but other geometries unsolved
3) Stefan's work studied stability of GIVEN solutions
4) lots of work on slightly broken degeneracies, in general, no steady state

New:
- general way to find degenerate lasing solutions, if they exist, Scalable SALT
- analytical solution near threshold, analytic stability of "circulating" solutions and its generalization
- starting point for SALT above threshold
- compensate for numerical symmetry breaking
