\begin_layout Abstract
We present a general method to obtain the stable lasing solutions for the
 steady-state 
\emph on
ab-initio
\emph default
 lasing theory (SALT) for the case of a degenerate symmetric laser in two
 dimensions (2d).
 We find that under most regimes (with one pathological exception), the
 stable solutions are clockwise and counterclockwise circulating modes,
 generalizing previously known results of ring lasers to all 2d rotational
 symmetry groups.
 Our method uses a combination of semi-analytical solutions close to lasing
 threshold and numerical solvers to track the lasing modes far above threshold.
 Near threshold, we find closed-form expressions for both circulating modes
 and other types of lasing solutions as well as for their linearized Maxwell–Blo
ch eigenvalues, providing a simple way to determine their stability without
 having to do a full numerical calculation.
 Above threshold, we show that a key feature of the circulating mode is
 its

\end_inset

 intensity pattern, which arises from spontaneous symmetry-breaking of mirror
 symmetry, and whose symmetry group requires that the degeneracy persist
 even when nonlinear effects become important.
 Finally, we introduce a numerical technique to solve the degenerate SALT
 equations far above threshold even when spatial discretization artificially
 breaks the degeneracy.

\begin_layout Standard
Many lasers are formed from high-symmetry microcavity geometries that have
 degenerate resonant modes, most famously ring and disc resonators in which
 the clockwise and counterclockwise circulating modes are degenerate (having
 the same complex resonant frequency).
 In a linear system, any superposition of these solutions also satisfies
 Maxwell's equations, but above-threshold lasers have nonlinear gain that
 allows only certain superpositions; it is well known that the only stable
 lasing solutions of a ring are the circulating solutions

 Previous work

 showed how the steady-state degenerate solutions of SALT (steady-state

) could be found from an educated guess of a superposition of the threshold
 degenerate modes, and how their stability could be computed 
\emph on
numerically
\emph default
.
 In this work, we show rigorously using degenerate perturbation theory on
 the SALT equations that the circulating modes used in Ref.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, along with standing-wave modes that are linear combinations of the clockwise
 and counterclockwise circulating modes, are the 
\emph on
only 
\emph default
solutions to SALT in the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 degenerate case.
 We complement those results with semi-analytical 
\emph on
closed-form
\emph default
 expressions for the stability eigenvalues of the Maxwell--Bloch equations
 linearized about these lasing solutions (Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Threshold-perturbation-theory"

\end_inset

).
 We empirically find that the only stable solutions right above threshold
 (with one isolated exception that is unattainable under normal circumstances)
 are the circulating ones.
 These analytical solutions then give us a starting point for a 
\emph on
numerical
\emph default
 method to compute the degenerate solutions far above threshold, extending
 our earlier work on computational methods for non-degenerate SALT
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Our numerical method, in turn, relies on a new semi-analytical technique
 (Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Forcing-the-degeneracy"

\end_inset

) to address problems created by numerical symmetry breaking (e.g.
 by a low-symmetry computational grid) that would otherwise spoil the nonlinear
 SALT solutions.

\begin_layout Standard
In Ref.

\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Stability-analysis summary"

\end_inset

) was applied numerically to the Maxwell--Bloch equations of lasing in order
 to check whether the steady state was stable, and stability of the solution
 was also analyzed when the degeneracy was broken by a perturbation.
 This generalized many earlier works on ring-laser solutions and perturbations
 thereof

 It reproduced the stability of the circulating solution near threshold,
 and found that far above the lasing threshold (where nonlinearities are
 strong) the circulating solution may become unstable (replaced by an oscillatin
g limit-cycle solution).
 Conversely, they found that slightly breaking the symmetry caused the (now
 nearly degenerate) solution to become unstable (e.g.
 oscillating between clockwise and counterclockwise modes) in the vicinity
 of the threshold, but that a stable solution re-appears further above threshold
 by means of cooperative frequency locking

 The present paper complements those results in two ways.
 First, near threshold, we are able to both

analytically

, by perturbation theory in the basis of the degenerate linear solutions
 at lasing threshold, and we generalize the notion of a circulating laser
 mode to other symmetry groups and establish its stability near threshold.
 (Even the degeneracy itself is somewhat unusual above threshold, because
 the nonlinear gain spontaneously breaks some of the symmetry in noncircular
 (

 provide an elegant formulation of the problem of steady-state lasing modes:
 they analytically eliminate the time dependence from the Maxwell–Bloch
 equations to obtain a nonlinear Maxwell-like eigenproblem

 As described below and also in previous work
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ref-rotter_degeneracy,modeswitching2014"

\end_inset

, the SALT framework applies very naturally to lasing of degenerate microcavitie
s, assuming a stable degenerate steady state exists, but it turns out that
 there are two complications.
 First, in order to apply a numerical nonlinear solver to a large system
 of nonlinear equations like SALT, one needs to have a good 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

starting guess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the solution.
 In the non-degenerate case, the starting guess is supplied by the threshold
 solution, but for a degenerate threshold there are infinitely many superpositio
ns.
 Picking the wrong starting guess, e.g.
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin(m\phi)$
\end_inset

 mode in a ring, would lead SALT to converge to an unstable solutions, but
 our near-threshold perturbutation theory supplies us with a correct guess
 (which turns out to be the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 analog of the circulating solution in the ring).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, there is a tricky complication that arises purely from 
\emph on
numerical
\emph default
 effects when a practical computational method is applied to spatially discretiz
e the SALT equations.
 In principle, what one would like to find from a degenerate SALT solver
 is a lasing mode (e.g.
 the clockwise circulating mode of a ring) with a passive pole (a pole of
 the Green's function linearized around the lasing solution) that coincides
 with the lasing frequency (there will be two possible lasing modes, e.g.
 clockwise and counterclockwise, but only one solution can exist at a time
 with nonzero amplitude due to the nonlinearity; which one is found will
 depend on the starting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

guess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the SALT solver).
 However, when one discretizes a microcavity geometry for a numerical solver,
 e.g.
 in a finite-difference or finite-element method, often the discretization
 itself breaks the symmetry and hence breaks the degeneracy slightly, causing
 the passive pole to separate from the lasing frequency.
 In a linear eigenproblem, this is at worst a minor annoyance, because from
 the symmetry group one can easily identify resonance modes that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

should
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 be degenerate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "inui_group,tinkham"

\end_inset

.
 In the nonlinear problem, however, the splitting can prevent the desired
 solution (e.g.
 the circulating mode) from existing in the SALT equations, because the
 solver can no longer pick arbitrary superpositions of the formerly degenerate
 modes, as described in Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Forcing-the-degeneracy"

\end_inset

.
 (If the discretization breaks the degeneracy, but the pump strength is
 high enough, a single-mode circulating solution 
\emph on
may
\emph default
 still come back into existance, due to strong nonlinear self-interaction
 effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ref-rotter_degeneracy"

\end_inset

.
 This effect can provide a fast and easy way to initially evaluate the field
 profile of a discretized geometry that is not exactly symmetric, and hence
 does not have an exact degeneracy.
 However, the conditions under which this effect can happen are not completely
 understood, as we explain in Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:discretization_breaking"

\end_inset

, and we wish to deal with the discretization symmetry breaking in a more
 systematic and provably reliable manner.) To fix the problem of broken degenerac
y from discretization, we found a simple way to uniquely restore the degeneracy
 in a way that both guarantees convergence to the correct solution (as the
 discretization is refined), that generalizes to an arbitrary number of
 lasing modes (in Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

), and that is, at worst, a few times more computationally expensive than
 our non-degenerate solver.

Effects of exact degeneracies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, most cases in which SALT has been applied have dealt with either
 single lasing modes or multimode regimes in which frequencies are far apart.
 When two lasing frequencies are close but not exactly degenerate, there
 is non-negligible beating and SALT is invalid.
 However, when two lasing modes are 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 degenerate, we find that SALT is still perfectly valid, because there is
 an exact steady-state solution of the MB equations (for a single lasing
 mode), provided that interference between the two degenerate modes is taken
 into account.
 Of course, it is possible that a degeneracy in the linear regime may split
 in the presence of the laser nonlinearity above threshold.
 However, if a degeneracy persists (and we have observed that it is guaranteed
 to do so for 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 symmetry-induced degeneracies, because of the

\begin_layout Standard
Ordinarily, SALT assumes that all distinct modes have distinct frequencies,
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\mu}\neq\omega_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\neq\nu$
\end_inset

, which gives the stationary-inversion expression Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 when higher-frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\mu}-\omega_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\neq\mu$
\end_inset

) terms are dropped.
 However, when there are degeneracies, the MB equations will have terms
 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{\mu}\cdot\mathbf{E}_{\nu}^{\star}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\neq\nu$
\end_inset

, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\mu}=\omega_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and one can no longer drop the 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i(\omega_{\mu}-\omega_{\nu})t}$
\end_inset

 term.
 The correct expression for the stationary inversion will then be
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D=\frac{D_{0}}{1+\gamma_{\parallel}^{-1}\sum^{\prime}\Gamma_{\mu}\mathbf{E}_{\mu}\cdot\Gamma_{\nu}^{\star}\mathbf{E}_{\nu}^{\star}},\label{eq:Dcorrect}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\mu}\equiv\Gamma(\omega_{\mu})$

\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\mu}=\omega_{\nu}$
\end_inset

, not just for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\nu$
\end_inset

 To illustrate the difference between the two, we examine a case in which
 there are three lasing modes, two of which are degenerate with each other
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}=\omega_{2}\neq\omega_{3}$
\end_inset

).
 Equation

\left|\Gamma_{1}(\mathbf{E}_{1}+\mathbf{E}_{2})\right|^{2}+\left|\Gamma_{3}\mathbf{E}_{3}\right|^{2}.\label{eq:E123}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 we see that the degenerate pair acts as a single mode that is a superposition
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This means that the solution to the lasing degenerate problem can be portrayed
 in two equivalent pictures.
 First, we can think of the linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}_{1}+\mathbf{E}_{2}$
\end_inset

 as a single mode that satisfies the equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
-\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{E} & =\omega_{1}^{2}\left(\varepsilon+D\Gamma_{1}\right)\mathbf{E}\nonumber \\
D & \equiv\frac{D_{0}}{1+\gamma_{\parallel}^{-1}\left(\left|\Gamma_{1}\mathbf{E}\right|^{2}+\left|\Gamma_{3}\mathbf{E}_{3}\right|^{2}\right)}\label{eq:1mode_salt}
\end{align}

\end_inset

[where the external pump 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{0}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 may be spatially dependent, as noted before].
 Second, we can think of the two modes as 
\emph on
separately 
\emph default
satisfying the two equations
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
-\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_{1,2} & =\omega_{1}^{2}\left(\varepsilon+D\Gamma_{1}\right)\mathbf{E}_{1,2}\nonumber \\
D & \equiv\frac{D_{0}}{1+\gamma_{\parallel}^{-1}\left(\left|\Gamma_{1}(\mathbf{E}_{1}+\mathbf{E}_{2})\right|^{2}+\left|\Gamma_{3}\mathbf{E}_{3}\right|^{2}\right)}.\label{eq:2mode_salt}
\end{align}

\end_inset

The existence of a solution to Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of a solution
 to Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:2mode_salt"

\end_inset

.
 The reason is that Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:2mode_salt"

\end_inset

 enforces a double eigenvalue of the linearized eigenproblem (i.e.
 a double pole of the Green's function) on the real-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 axis, whereas Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:1mode_salt"

\end_inset

 only enforces a single eigenvalue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to lasing, suppose that we have a 2-fold degenerate solution, correspondin
g to a double pole in the Green function.
 As the gain increases, and even when the system passes threshold and becomes
 nonlinear, poles can shift (and degeneracies may split) but poles do not
 appear or disappear discontinuously, so we should always expect there to
 be two poles (in the linearized Green's function around the SALT solution)
 arising from the original degenerate pair.
 Given this fact, if we solve the single-mode SALT equations as in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:1mode_salt"

\end_inset

, there is the danger that the other pole is unstable.
 As we show in Appendix.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: appendix stability calculations"

\end_inset

, close to lasing threshold the zeroth order stability analysis (in the
 pump strength increment) simply depends on the SALT eigenproblem: if a
 SALT pole lies above the real-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 axis, then lasing solution is necessarily unstable, whereas SALT poles
 below the real axis cannot induce instability.
 If a pole lies 
\emph on
on
\emph default
 the real axis, higher-order calculations are required to check stability
 as described in Sec.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, if we find a solution of the two-mode SALT equations
 as in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:2mode_salt"

\end_inset

, then by construction we have placed both poles together on the real-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 axis and the other passive pole by itself is not a source of instability
 (and the overall stability of the Maxwell–Bloch equations can be checked
 as in Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 However, Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 has a drawback: the hole-burning term now depends on the relative phase
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In the original SALT equations, even for multimode problems, the phase
 was irrelevant and was chosen arbitrarily in order to obtain a solvable
 system of equations.
 If we remove the arbitrary phase choice, our equations (derived in Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) become underdetermined.
 However, if we solve the single-mode equation (Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) but simultaneously constrain the other pole (the linearly independent
 degenerate partner) to be degenerate with the lasing pole, then we will
 effectively have solved Eq.

 First (Sec.

 of whether they are stable.
 Then (Sec.

, in order to evaluate the dynamical stability of the SALT modes.
 This yields a small

 elements are integrals of the threshold solutions.
 In the case of

 calculations analytically, to conclude: (i) the only SALT solutions are
 either standing-wave or circulating solutions (defined below); (ii) the

 cases (except for a small group of isolated, realistically unattainable

 First, there are the purely circulating modes, given by
\begin_inset Formula

\omega_{1} & =-\frac{\mathrm{Im}\left(G_{D}/I\right)}{\mathrm{Im}\left(H/I\right)}.\label{eq:circulating lasing}

\end_inset

The other solutions to Eq.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 are 
\emph on
standing-wave 
\emph default
modes, as to be expected, and it turns out their form depends (as explained
 in Appendix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) crucially on whether the irrep of the degenerate pair satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4\ell$
\end_inset

, where again 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 is the order of the 2d irrep.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n\neq4\ell$
\end_inset

, the other modes are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mathbf{E} & =\Gamma_{\mathrm{t}}^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{(\omega_{1}H+G_{D})\gamma_{\parallel}d}{2I+J}}\left(\mathbf{E}_{+}+e^{i\theta}\mathbf{E}_{-}\right)\nonumber \\
\omega_{1} & =-\frac{\mathrm{Im}\left(G_{D}/[2I+J]\right)}{\mathrm{Im}\left(H/[2I+J]\right)}\label{eq:n != 4 lasing}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary phase angle.
 (During numerical solution of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we have found that for some 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

, there seem to be constraints on 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, namely having to be a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi}{n}$
\end_inset

.
 These constraints probably come from equations that are higher-order in
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 than our perturbation theory.
 However, they are inconsequential because it turns out that these standing-wave
 modes are always unstable, regardless of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.) On the other hand, for the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4\ell$
\end_inset

, there are 
\emph on
two 
\emph default
sets of standing-wave modes.
 The first is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mathbf{E} & =\Gamma_{\mathrm{t}}^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{(\omega_{1}H+G_{D})\gamma_{\parallel}d}{2I+J+K}}\left(\mathbf{E}_{+}\pm\mathbf{E}_{-}\right)\nonumber \\
\omega_{1} & =-\frac{\mathrm{Im}\left(G_{D}/[2I+J+K]\right)}{\mathrm{Im}\left(H/[2I+J+K]\right)}\label{eq:E+ + E- lasing}
\end{align}

\end_inset

and the other is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mathbf{E} & =\Gamma_{\mathrm{t}}^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{(\omega_{1}H+G_{D})\gamma_{\parallel}d}{2I+J-K}}\left(\mathbf{E}_{+}\pm i\mathbf{E}_{-}\right)\nonumber \\
\omega_{1} & =-\frac{\mathrm{Im}\left(G_{D}/[2I+J-K]\right)}{\mathrm{Im}\left(H/[2I+J-K]\right)}.\label{eq:E+ + i E- lasing}
\end{align}

\end_inset

These four sets of solutions turn out to constitute all the solutions of

 It turns out that this test can also be done mostly analytically, using

While these three forms of lasing modes all solve SALT near threshold, and
 hence are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 equilibria of the Maxwell--Bloch equations, one intuitively expects that
 only the circulating mode will be stable.
 The reason is that standing-wave modes for the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 group have zero amplitude along certain lines, most obviously along 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{odd}}$
\end_inset

 mode, and those zero-amplitude regions are making no use of the gain.
 This allows the opposite-symmetry standing-wave mode to grow exponentially
 into these nulls, and this is the reason why the sine and cosine modes
 are unstable in a ring.
 (This fact is only true for 
\emph on
exact 
\emph default
degeneracies; for real systems, which almost always break the degeneracy,
 there may be small regions near threshold where the standing-wave mode
 is stable

 Here, we focus on the regime slightly above threshold, and show that the
 equations can be solved analytically to lowest order in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, and this is enough to evaluate near-threshold stability.
 We begin by noting that the matrices can be expanded as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mathsf{A} & =\mathsf{A}_{0}+\mathsf{A}_{1/2}\sqrt{d}+\mathsf{A}_{1}d+\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2})\nonumber \\

\mathsf{C} & =\mathsf{C}_{0}\nonumber

\end_inset

(where

 is the relative pump increment above threshold, as introduced in Sec.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and other associated fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 As a result, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can also be expanded this
 way:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mathsf{x} & =\mathsf{x}_{0}+\mathsf{x}_{1/2}\sqrt{d}+\mathsf{x}_{1}d+\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2})\nonumber \\

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 First, there are the below threshold

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "tureci_self-consistent_2006,ge_steady-state_2010"

\end_inset

, which have 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re(\sigma_{0})<0$
\end_inset

 (because for these modes, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 is simply the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\omega}-\omega_{\mathrm{t}}$
\end_inset

 between the complex pole 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\omega}$
\end_inset

 of the passive mode and the real threshold frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\mathrm{t}}$
\end_inset

) and hence are stable.
 Therefore, when 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is small enough, we can say for certain that having one of these 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 above the real axis would make the system unstable, so having all passive
 poles of the SALT equation be below the real axis is a 
\emph on
necessary 
\emph default
condition for lasing near threshold, for small 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 (Far above threshold, however, this is no longer true, as shown in Ref.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\emph on
threshold
\emph default
 modes, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\sigma_{0} & =0\nonumber \\
\mathsf{x}_{0} & =\sum_{k=1}^{4}b_{k}\mathsf{v}_{k},\label{eq:zeroth order}

\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$

 are arbitrary complex coefficients that will determined later at higher

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1,2,3,4}=\mathbf{E}_{1},\mathbf{E}_{2},i\mathbf{E}_{1},i\mathbf{E}_{2}$

 Again, there is a zero eigenvalue coming from the global phase degree of

 For almost all cases, we have empirically observed that the second eigenvalue
 has a negative real part, but also 
\begin_inset Formula $-\Im\left(\frac{J+3K}{H}\right)>0$

 However, there are pathological cases where the gain profile

 However, there are pathological delta-function cases where the external

 However, if the mirror symmetry is broken, then we no longer have

There are two ways for mirror symmetry to be broken: first, for a 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

-symmetric geometry [dielectric function 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 and gain profile 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{0}(\mathbf{x})$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 turn out to have 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 symmetry as opposed to 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 symmetry due to spontaneous breaking of mirror symmetry as soon as the
 mode starts lasing (the only exception to this rule is for a 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\infty\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 system, in which the circulating lasing modes have an intensity pattern
 
\begin_inset Formula $|\mathbf{E}|^{2}\propto|e^{i\ell\phi}|^{2}=1$
\end_inset

, and hence still have mirror symmetry).
 We have also empirically observed that circulating lasing modes in 
\emph on

).
 Second, the geometry itself can already have 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 symmetry, e.g.
 the dielectric and gain functions themselves have chirality.
 Whether the chirality is due to the intensity pattern of a lasing mode
 or due to the geometry itself, the effects are the same.

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}_{+}$

 will be an exact mirror flip of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{E}}_{-}$
\end_inset

, due to the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$

 The lasing frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 will also be independent of whether 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{+}$

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{-}$
\end_inset

 lases, as confirmed by Eq.

 On the other hand, if the laser already had 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 symmetry at threshold (either due to chirality in a previously lasing mode
 or in the dielectric or gain functions), then the threshold eigenfunctions
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 are no longer mirror flips of each other, even though their threshold frequenci

).
 The fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{+}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{-}$
\end_inset

 are not mirror flips of each other causes a splitting between the overlap
 integrals 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{+}$

\begin_inset Formula $I_{-}$
\end_inset

, as well as in 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\pm}$

 As a consequence, the expressions for the amplitude 
\begin_inset Formula $|a|$
\end_inset

 and the frequency shift

\end_inset

 in Eq.

 lases, and

 if

 lases.
 Hence, if the symmetry is only 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 at threshold, the clockwise and counterclockwise lasing modes would also
 have different amplitudes and frequencies, in addition to not being related
 to each other by a mirror flip operation.
 These facts allow us to imagine a situation in which there is a

Multimode lasing

So far, the discussion and examples in this paper have dealt with the case
 in which only one pair of degenerate modes are lasing.
 The generalization to the case of multimode lasing (i.e.
 multiple nondegenerate and degenerate lasing modes all lasing simultaneously)
 is straightforward.
 Since our method combines degenerate pairs into a single mode that is the
 stable linear combination (as given by the perturbation theory in Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 the degenerate pairs are always treated as a single mode.
 As in previous work on SALT 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ge_steady-state_2010,tureci_self-consistent_2006,direct_salt"

 effect of their spatial hole-burning is used to track the passive modes
 and add any mode (degenerate or nondegenerate) that crosses threshold to
 the list of lasing modes.
 The only aspects of our method requiring generalization are the threshold

, since the grid may no longer have the original

 For linear equations, this unphysical splitting is not an issue because
 it is usually straightforward to tell whether a pair of modes is

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 degenerate by how it corresponds to the eigenfunctions of the

 in the infinite-resolution limit, we can construct arbitrary superpositions
 as needed 
\emph on
after 
\emph default
solving for both of the modes.
 However, for SALT (which is nonlinear), the coefficients of the superposition
 is a physical quantity that must be found by our solution method, as explained
 in Sec.

.
 As explained in Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "direct_salt"

\end_inset

, the process for solving for lasing modes begins with the linear problem
 for the passive poles.
 Because both the real and imaginary parts of the passive poles are split
 by the discretization error, the modes will lase at different pump strengths,
 and even after both modes lase we cannot construct a linear combination
 of them because the two modes satisfy equations with different real eigenfreque
ncies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the pump strength is sufficiently high above threshold, however, the
 two near-degenerate modes can interact with each other via the nonlinear
 spatial hole burning interaction to form a single stable laser mode.
 This effect is commonly known as cooperative frequency locking

 For example, Ref.

 found instances where artificially breaking a degeneracy on purpose, such
 as by introducing a wedge to a single location on the rim of a ring laser,
 can result in the circulating mode not existing near threshold as expected,
 but coming back 
\emph on
into
\emph default
 existence (once the pump strength is high enough above threshold and the
 nonlinearity is strong enough) as a modified version that is not perfectly
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

circulating
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but nearly so.
 We have found similar results in hexagonal (
\begin_inset Formula $C_{6\mathrm{v}})$
\end_inset

 structures 
\emph on
without 
\emph default
artifically-introduced defects, in which the degeneracy is broken by discretizat
ion alone.
 There, a circulating single-mode lasing solution starts existing above
 a certain pump strength (somewhat higher than threshold), even though there
 is no degeneracy at threshold.
 The reason the circulating lasing mode requires a minimum pump strength
 is that the nonlinearity must be strong enough to counteract the broken
 degeneracy and to lock the two modes to a single frequency.
 In many cases such as these, numerically solving the single mode problem,
 using an artificially-constructed circulating solution as an initial guess,
 results in the solver correctly converging to a circulating lasing mode.
 However, this effect is not yet completely understood, and it is not entirely
 predictable under what circumstances such a circulating mode exists.
 Furthermore, the pump window between the original lasing threshold and
 the threshold at which the stable circular mode emerges can not be described
 with SALT as the electric field no longer shows a multi-periodic time dependenc
y 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ref-lugiato-josa,ref-tamm"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, a discretization-induced error and a physical perturbation breaking
 the degeneracy are two distinct effects (even if their consequences are
 mathematically similar), and it is important to be able to study them independe
ntly.
 When one is studying a physical symmetry-breaking defect, one does not
 want to accidentally observe an artificial effect of discretization instead.
 Consequently, degeneracy-splitting caused by discretization is a major
 practical problem for our SALT solver and requires a nontrivial solution.
 For a rigorous study of the circulating solution we therefore construct
 a small perturbation to the dielectric function to force a degeneracy in
 both the pump strength and the frequencies at threshold.
 We discuss this method below.

 A perfectly matched layer (PML) is added to the boundaries to simulate
 the radiation loss, and the axes of the hexagon have been aligned with

 happens to only have mirror symmetry along the diagonals.
 Here, the lasing modes are TE (electric field in-plane and magnetic field
 out of plane), but there is a pair of degenerate threshold modes from the

 The two are related to each other by linear combinations of sixfold and
 threefold rotations.
 However, these operations do not belong in the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{4\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 symmetry group of the discretized grid, so the degeneracy here is again
 only approximate.
 For a 
\begin_inset Formula $100\times100$
\end_inset

 finite-difference discretization, there is about a 1.5% splitting between
 the threshold eigenvalues, so again we must use the QP procedure to force
 the threshold degeneracy.
 Since these are TE modes, we now have

 Again, only two iterations of QP are necessary to force the degeneracy
 down to machine precision, and the perturbation used to force the degeneracy

Concluding Remarks

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we have reduced the problem of identifying the stable lasing
 modes of a degenerate laser from the full nonlinear Maxwell--Bloch equations
 to a small 
\emph on
semi-analytical
\emph default
 solution evaluated in terms of integrals of  the threshold modes (solutions
 to the 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 Maxwell partial-differential equation).
 Our perturbative solution near threshold confirms an ansatz in the earlier
 degenerate SALT work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ref-rotter_degeneracy"

\end_inset

, in which the circulating and standing wave solutions were guessed as starting
 points for a SALT solver and it was conjectured that the resulting four
 solutions were the only possibilities.
 Furthermore, we have presented an efficient numerical scheme to track these
 solutions far above threshold via numerical SALT solvers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 combined with a simple technique to correct for numerical symmetry breaking.
 And finally, we have shown that the degeneracy of the

 group Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Effects-of-chirality"

\end_inset

 means that circulating lasing modes will retain a degenerate passive pole
 even far above threshold, where the hole-burning term breaks mirror symmetry.
 In addition, our work poses some intriguing open questions for future research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, although we have reduced the question of stability of circulating
 modes near threshold to a simple semi-analytical criterion (checking whether
 a certain integral expression is positive), one would like to additionally
 have a fully analytical proof that the circulating modes are stable, or
 alternatively a counter-example of a 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

-symmetric problem with a degenerate lasing threshold in which the circulating
 mode is unstable.
 (Since Ref.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ref-rotter_degeneracy"

\end_inset

 found that circulating modes can become unstable at higher pump strengths,
 one might naively hope that the technique of Ref.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ref-lige_condensation_arxiv"

\end_inset

 [in which a lasing SALT solution at some pump strength above threshold
 is transformed into a threshold SALT solution by designing the pump profile
 at threshold to match the hole-burning term at the higher pump strength]
 could be used to translate these into an unstable threshold circulating
 mode.
 However, Ref.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ref-lige_condensation_arxiv"

\end_inset

 only translates one SALT solution into another, and does not translate
 the full Maxwell--Bloch solutions, e.g.
 it is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

.
 Because the exact Maxwell--Bloch stability eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

, as explained in Appendix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Region-of-validity"

\end_inset

 (only the first-order term 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 is independent), and SALT solutions do not, this method of translating
 a hole-burning term to an artificially-designed pump profile at a higher
 threshold does not account for the effects of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, it would be interesting to extend this sort of perturbative SALT/stabili
ty analysis to other lasing systems besides 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 symmetries.
 For example, in a 3d photonic-crystal cavity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "phc_book"

\end_inset

 one could have cubic symmetry and threefold degeneracies, or one could
 have even greater degeneracies in spherical resonators.
 Alternatively, in a surface-emitting distributed feedback 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 or photonic-crystal laser 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ref-imada_phc_distributed,ref-continuous_phc_bandedge,ref-ryu_bandedge,ref-coherent_surface_emitting_phc"

, one might have lasing occur at a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

band edge
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 While a band edge may or may not be degenerate 
\emph on
per se
\emph default
, it coincides with a singularity in the density of states 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ashcroft-mermin"

\end_inset

 where a continuum of resonances occurs in a small neighborhood of the lasing
 resonance, and perturbative analysis might be very helpful in understanding
 its stability.
 Finally, it would be interesting to apply semi-analytical perturbative
 stability analysis to cases where a small imperfection slightly splits
 the degeneracy, which was studied numerically in Ref.

 (The TCF approach is slightly different, for it assumes that the eigenvalues

 that

 Because this set is a complete basis for functions of this chirality, the
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathbf{E}^{+})^{\star}$
\end_inset

 (which transforms in the same way as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{j}^{-}$
\end_inset

 because the rotation operator

\begin_inset Formula

First, we define the 
\emph on
unconjugated 
\emph default
inner product 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g}\right)\equiv\int d^{3}x\,\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{g}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, for appropriate boundary conditions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}(\omega^{+})$
\end_inset

 is complex symmetric, that is: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{f},\hat{L}\mathbf{g}\right)=\left(\hat{L}\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g}\right)$
\end_inset

 for reciprocal materials 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{T}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\mu^{T}$
\end_inset

, and this is known as Lorentz reciprocity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}(\omega^{+})$
\end_inset

 is complex symmetric, its eigenfunctions with distinct eigenvalues are
 orthogonal; that is: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{E}_{i}^{-},\mathbf{E}_{j}^{-}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}\neq\lambda_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Now write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\int d^{3}x\,\left|\mathbf{E}^{+}\right|^{2} & =\sum b_{j}\left(\mathbf{E}^{+},\mathbf{E}_{j}^{-}\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset

If all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{j}^{-}$
\end_inset

 had 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}\neq0$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{E}^{+}\cdot\mathbf{E}_{j}^{-}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 However, the left-hand side is obviously positive, so at least one term
 in the sum on the right-hand side must be non-vanishing.
 Hence, this term has the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}=0$
\end_inset

, and it is precisely the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}^{-}$
\end_inset

 that is degenerate to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}^{+}$

.

\begin_layout Standard
In this appendix, we show that the only allowed lasing modes for 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 geometries above threshold are the circulating modes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 and standing-wave modes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{+}+e^{i\theta}\mathbf{E}_{-}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 an arbitrary angle for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\neq4\ell$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 is the order of the 2d irrep that the degenerate modes transform as), and
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 an integer multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi}{2}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4\ell$
\end_inset

.
 We begin by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{0}=D_{\mathrm{t}}(1+d)$
\end_inset

 and inserting into Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 We expand to lowest order in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and the mode intensity, and we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{E}=\omega^{2}\left[\varepsilon+D_{\mathrm{t}}\Gamma\left(1+d-\gamma_{\parallel}^{-1}\left|\Gamma\mathbf{E}\right|^{2}\right)\right]\mathbf{E}.\label{eq:expanded salt}

\end_inset

Comparing with Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 at threshold, we conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$
\end_inset

, and that the profile should be some linear combination of the threshold
 modes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{1,2}$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
\left[\nabla\times\nabla\times-\:\omega_{\mathrm{t}}^{2}\left(\varepsilon+D_{\mathrm{t}}\Gamma_{\mathrm{t}}\right)\right]\delta\mathbf{E}\\
=\left\{ \omega_{1}\frac{\partial}{\partial\omega_{\mathrm{t}}}\left[\omega_{\mathrm{t}}^{2}\left(\varepsilon+D_{\mathrm{t}}\Gamma_{\mathrm{t}}\right)\right]+\omega_{\mathrm{t}}^{2}D_{\mathrm{t}}\Gamma_{\mathrm{t}}\left(1-\left|\mathbf{f}\right|^{2}\right)\right\} \mathbf{f}
\end{multline}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}\equiv a_{1}\mathbf{E}_{1}+a_{2}\mathbf{E}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Now multiply by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{1,2}$

 and integrate over all space, and we obtain Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\int d^{3}x\,\mathbf{E}_{1,2}\cdot\left[\nabla\times\nabla\times-\:\omega_{\mathrm{t}}^{2}\left(\varepsilon+D_{\mathrm{t}}\Gamma_{\mathrm{t}}\right)\right]\delta\mathbf{E}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

because the threshold Maxwell operator is complex-symmetric 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 so that it acts to the left and annihilates 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 (The fact that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\times\nabla\times$
\end_inset

 operator acts to the left can be understood using integration by parts,
 with the boundary terms vanishing due to the limiting-absorption principle
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.) Now, choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{1}=\mathbf{E}_{+}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{2}=\mathbf{E}_{-}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 is defined in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 For generality, we assume that the geometry [i.e.
 the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\mathrm{t}}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

] has at least 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 symmetry.
 In Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:a eigenproblem"

\end_inset

, we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int d^{3}x\varepsilon(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{E}_{+}\cdot\mathbf{E}_{+}$
\end_inset

 vanishes, because it is the conjugated inner product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{+}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{+}^{\star}$
\end_inset

, which transform as the clockwise and counterclockwise 1d irreps in the
 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 group, and from the great orthogonality theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "inui_group,tinkham"

\end_inset

, conjugated inner products between functions belonging to different irreps
 always vanish [e.g.
 for circulating modes on a uniform ring, the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int d\phi\,e^{i\ell\phi}(e^{-i\ell\phi})^{\star}$
\end_inset

 vanishes].
 Also, the integral over 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\mathrm{t}}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is the same, because it also has at least 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 symmetry.
 Excluding the intensity term in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:a eigenproblem"

\end_inset

, the rest of the terms become
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{\mp}\left(\omega_{1}H+G_{D}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we have defined
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
G_{\varepsilon} & \equiv\int d^{3}x\,\varepsilon(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{E}_{+}\cdot\mathbf{E}_{-}\nonumber \\
G_{D} & \equiv\int d^{3}x\,D_{\mathrm{t}}(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{E}_{+}\cdot\mathbf{E}_{-}.\label{eq:G and H definitions}\\
H & \equiv(\omega_{\mathrm{t}}^{2}\Gamma_{\mathrm{t}})^{-1}\frac{\partial}{\partial\omega_{\mathrm{t}}}\left\{ \omega_{\mathrm{t}}^{2}\left(G_{\varepsilon}+G_{D}\Gamma_{\mathrm{t}}\right)\right\} .\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

For the intensity term, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\int d^{3}x\,D_{\mathrm{t}}\mathbf{E}_{\pm}\cdot\mathbf{f}\left|\mathbf{f}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We note that the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{E}_{\pm}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{+}\cdot\mathbf{E}_{-}$
\end_inset

 have 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 symmetry, so by symmetry arguments, the only surviving integrals are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
I_{\pm} & =\int d^{3}x\,D_{\mathrm{t}}\left|\vec{E}_{\pm}\right|^{2}\vec{E}_{+}\cdot\vec{E}_{-}\nonumber \\
J_{\pm} & =\int d^{3}x\,D_{\mathrm{t}}(\vec{E}_{\pm}^{\star}\cdot\vec{E}_{\mp})\vec{E}_{\pm}\cdot\vec{E}_{\pm}\label{eq:I J K definitions}\\
K_{\pm} & =\int d^{3}x\,D_{\mathrm{t}}(\vec{E}_{\mp}^{\star}\cdot\vec{E}_{\pm})\vec{E}_{\pm}\cdot\vec{E}_{\pm}.\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

Additionally, note that for 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{+}=I_{-}$
\end_inset

, and the same for 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 Further, for TM modes (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{\pm}=E_{\pm}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$
\end_inset

), we have 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{\pm}=J_{\pm}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 is only non-vanishing for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4\ell$
\end_inset

, since in that special case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{+}$
\end_inset

 picks up a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 under four-fold rotation, as seen in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

 With these definitions, Eq.

 straightforwardly reduces to Eq.

\begin_layout Standard
To solve for the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 and the frequency shift 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

, first consider the case 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{-}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Dividing Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:reduced a plus minus"

\end_inset

 (with the bottom sign) by 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{+}$
\end_inset

 then yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|a_{+}\right|^{2}=\frac{\omega_{1}H+G_{D}}{I_{+}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Taking the imaginary part of both sides, and noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

 is real, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
0=\omega_{1}\Im\left(\frac{H}{I_{+}}\right)+\Im\left(\frac{G_{D}}{I_{+}}\right),\label{eq:imaginary part of |a|^2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which leads to the circulating solution.
 (Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:circulating lasing"

\end_inset

 holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

; the same expression with 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 also holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{+}\neq I_{-}$
\end_inset

, so the two circulating lasing modes will actually have slightly different
 amplitudes and frequencies.) Note that the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a_{+}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 must be a positive number also gives a cutoff condition
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Re(G_{D}/I_{\pm})>\frac{\Im\left(G_{D}/I_{\pm}\right)}{\Im\left(H/I_{\pm}\right)}\Re(H/I_{\pm}).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we consider the case that both 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 are nonzero.
 Write 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\pm}=\left|a_{\pm}\right|e^{i\theta_{\pm}}$
\end_inset

 and define the relative phase 
\begin_inset Formula $z=e^{i(\theta_{-}-\theta_{+})}$
\end_inset

.
 Divide Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mp}$
\end_inset

, and we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|a_{\mp}\right|^{2}I_{\mp}+\left|a_{\pm}\right|^{2}\left(I_{\pm}+J_{\pm}+z^{\mp2}K_{\pm}\right)=\omega_{1}H+G_{D}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Solving this linear equation for the unknowns 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a_{\pm}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|a_{\pm}\right|^{2}=(\omega_{1}H+G_{D})T_{\pm},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\pm}=\frac{J_{\mp}+z^{\pm2}K_{\mp}}{\left(I_{+}+J_{+}+z^{-2}K_{+}\right)\left(I_{-}+J_{-}+z^{2}K_{-}\right)-I_{+}I_{-}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Again, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a_{\pm}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

 are real, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\omega_{1}=-\frac{\Im\left(G_{D}T_{+}\right)}{\Im\left(HT_{+}\right)}=-\frac{\Im\left(G_{D}T_{-}\right)}{\Im\left(HT_{-}\right)}.\label{eq:omega1 constraint}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The second equality here is a constraint that must be satisfied.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n\neq4\ell$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{+},J_{+}=I_{-},J_{-}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\pm}=0$
\end_inset

 (as explained previously), so 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{+}=T_{-}$
\end_inset

 and the constraint is automatically satisfied, indicating that 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is free to have any phase, and yielding the solution in Eq.

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n\neq4\ell$
\end_inset

, we again have 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\pm}=0$
\end_inset

, but there is no mirror symmetry so 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{+},J_{+}\neq I_{-},J_{-}$

 Hence, for

 This is because we have separated the problem into real and imaginary parts,
 and this separation will become significant at higher orders in

 It is straightforward to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{A}_{0}^{T}\mathsf{w}_{j}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Additionally, due to the nonzero pattern of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{A}_{1/2}$
\end_inset

, it is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{A}_{1/2}\mathsf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 has all zero elements except the last, and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{w}_{j}^{T}\mathsf{A}_{1/2}\mathsf{v}_{k}=0$

 The matrix

Next, we compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{A}_{1/2}\mathsf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 Since the only nonzero element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{A}_{1/2}\mathsf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the last, we define this element, after straightforward evaluation,
 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g_{k}\equiv2D_{\mathrm{t}}\left|\Gamma_{\mathrm{t}}\right|\sqrt{\gamma_{\parallel}}\Re\left[\vec{e}_{k}^{\star}\cdot(a_{+}\vec{E}_{+}+a_{-}\vec{E}_{-})\right].

\end_inset

The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{1/2}$
\end_inset

 must also have this same nonzero pattern, because if it had any nonzero
 elements in the first four, they must be annihilated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{A}_{0}$
\end_inset

 and hence must be some linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 (which is already accounted for in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{0}$
\end_inset

 and would be redundant).
 Hence, we immediately conclude by inspection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{A}_{0}$
\end_inset

 that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathsf{x}_{1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c}

A second eigenpair is

Empirically, we have found that this eigenvalue is always stable.
 The final two eigenvalues are

\end_inset

, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$

\begin_inset Formula $z=\pm i$

 There is an eigenpair with zero eigenvalue:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{1}=0,\;\mathsf{b}=\left(\begin{array}{c}

and another eigenpair
\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

Empirically, we have found that this eigenvalue is always stable.
 Finally, the remaining two eigenvalues are

\begin{multline}
\sigma_{1}=|a|^{2}\Im\left(\frac{3K-J}{H}\right)\pm\\
|a|^{2}\sqrt{\Im\left(\frac{J+K}{H}\right)^{2}+8\Re\left(\frac{K}{H}\right)\Re\left(\frac{J-K}{H}\right)}\label{eq:z = i double eigenvalues}
\end{multline}

(the eigenvectors can be written down in closed form, but are tedious and

 Empirically, we have found that at least one of these two eigenvalues are
 unstable, except for an isolated case that we will now explain.

\begin_layout Standard
We note that for the previous two cases, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4\ell$
\end_inset

 actually becomes 
\emph on

\emph default

 To see this, we consider a

 Equation.

 then becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}_{\pm}=\sum_{b=1}^{n}(\pm i)^{b}R_{b/n}\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{even}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The specific choice of geometry requires that we place radially-symmetric
 lines of gain on the faces or diagonals of the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 geometry, which preserves the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n\mathrm{v}}$
\end_inset

 symmetry.
 We can write this as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D_{\mathrm{t}}(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{a=1}^{n}G(r)\delta\left(\theta-\theta_{a}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{a}=\frac{2\pi a}{n}$
\end_inset

 for the faces, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{a}=(2a+1)\frac{\pi}{n}$
\end_inset

 for the diagonals.
 For a TM geometry, we then have the overlap integrals (Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
J & =\sum_{a=1}^{n}\int rdr\,G(r)\left|E_{+}\left(r,\theta_{a}\right)\right|^{2}E_{-}(r,\theta_{a})E_{+}(r,\theta_{a})\nonumber \\
K & =\sum_{a=1}^{n}\int rdr\,G(r)E_{+}(r,\theta_{a})^{\star}E_{-}(r,\theta_{a})^{3}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

It can be shown that depending on the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{a}$
\end_inset

 being the faces or diagonals, we will have either 
\begin_inset Formula $K=J$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $K=-J$

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we work out the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

 dependence of higher-order terms in the perturbation theory, and demonstrate
 that the regime of validity of the perturbation theory depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 being small compared to a constant multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

.
 We show that the exact expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma/d$
\end_inset

 to all orders in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 only contains terms of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{\ell}/\gamma_{\parallel}^{j}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\geq j$
\end_inset

, and that in the limit where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel},d\to0$

\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 vanishing at least as rapidly as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\ell>j$

 vanish and the stability eigenvalue takes the asymptotic functional form
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma/d=f(d/\gamma_{\parallel})$

 Here,

 is exactly the first-order stability eigenvalue

First, since we have already obtained closed-form expressions for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 and the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{0}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{1}=\mathsf{A}_{0}^{-1}\left[\left(\mathsf{B}_{0}\sigma_{1}+\mathsf{A}_{1}\right)\mathsf{x}_{0}+\mathsf{A}_{1/2}\mathsf{x}_{1/2}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Next, at order 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{3/2}$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
\mathsf{A}{}_{3/2}\mathsf{x}{}_{0}+\mathsf{A}{}_{1}\mathsf{x}{}_{1/2}+\mathsf{A}{}_{1/2}\mathsf{x}{}_{1}+\mathsf{A}{}_{0}\mathsf{x}{}_{3/2}\\
=-\mathsf{B}_{0}\sigma_{3/2}\mathsf{x}{}_{0}-\mathsf{B}_{0}\sigma_{1}\mathsf{x}{}_{1/2}.
\end{multline}

\end_inset

The first three terms on the left-hand side as well as the very last term
 on the right all have the same nonzero pattern as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{1/2}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, multiplying both sides by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{0}^{T}$
\end_inset

 (which is now known after having solved the degenerate problem at order
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

), we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $0=\sigma_{3/2}\mathsf{x}_{0}^{T}\mathsf{B}_{0}\mathsf{x}{}_{0}$
\end_inset

, which leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{3/2}=0$
\end_inset

.
 The only remaining unknown is then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{3/2}$
\end_inset

.
 By the same arguments leading to Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{A}{}_{0}\mathsf{x}{}_{3/2}=\gamma_{\parallel}\mathsf{x}{}_{3/2}$
\end_inset

, which yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{3/2}=-\gamma_{\parallel}^{-1}\mathsf{f}_{3/2}$
\end_inset

, where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathsf{f}_{3/2}\equiv\mathsf{A}{}_{3/2}\mathsf{x}{}_{0}+\mathsf{A}{}_{1}\mathsf{x}{}_{1/2}+\mathsf{A}{}_{1/2}\mathsf{x}{}_{1}+\mathsf{B}_{0}\sigma_{1}\mathsf{x}{}_{1/2},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{f}_{3/2}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(1)$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 it goes to a constant as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

.
 Moving onto order 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
\mathsf{C}\sigma_{1}^{2}\mathsf{x}_{0}+\mathsf{B}_{0}\left(\sigma_{2}\mathsf{x}{}_{0}+\sigma_{1}\mathsf{x}{}_{1}\right)+\mathsf{B}_{1}\sigma_{1}\mathsf{x}_{0}\\
=-\sum_{k=0}^{4}\mathsf{A}_{k/2}\mathsf{x}_{2-\frac{k}{2}}.
\end{multline}

\end_inset

Multiplying both sides by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{0}^{T}$
\end_inset

 annihilates the 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

 term, leaving only a single unknown 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{2}$
\end_inset

 and a single term of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\gamma_{\parallel}^{-1})$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $-\mathsf{A}_{1/2}\mathsf{x}_{3/2}=\gamma_{\parallel}^{-1}\mathsf{A}_{1/2}\mathsf{f}_{3/2}$
\end_inset

.
 We then have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{\parallel}\sigma_{2}=\frac{\mathsf{x}_{0}^{T}\mathsf{A}_{1/2}\mathsf{f}_{3/2}}{\mathsf{x}_{0}^{T}\mathsf{B}_{0}\mathsf{x}_{0}}+\mathcal{O}(\gamma_{\parallel}).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Carrying on to the next order results in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{5/2}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{5/2}=-\gamma_{\parallel}^{-1}\mathsf{f}_{5/2}$
\end_inset

, where now 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{f}_{5/2}=\mathcal{O}(\gamma_{\parallel}^{-1})$
\end_inset

 due to it including terms with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 By continuing this process, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{m+\frac{1}{2}}=0$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{m+\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{m+1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{m+1}$
\end_inset

 are all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\gamma_{\parallel}^{-m})$
\end_inset

.
 This is made possible by the fact that the only place 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

 occurs in the entire problem is the very last matrix element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{A}_{0}$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{m+\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{x}_{m}$
\end_inset

 have predictable nonzero patterns, due to the nonzero patterns of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{A}_{m+\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

 being different from those of all the other matrices.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m+1}\equiv\gamma_{\parallel}^{m}\sigma_{m+1}=\mathcal{O}(1)$
\end_inset

, we obtain a full expansion for the exact Maxwell--Bloch eigenvalue (Eq.

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma\approx d\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{d}{\gamma_{\parallel}}\right)^{k-1}s_{k},\label{eq:s expansion}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

 comes from the fact that we have thrown away terms of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{\ell}/\gamma_{\parallel}^{j}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell>j$
\end_inset

, which are negligible compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $(d/\gamma_{\parallel})^{k}$
\end_inset

 and vanish in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $d,\gamma_{\parallel}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 (provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

 does not go zero more rapidly than 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

).
 In this limit, we can then infer a generic functional form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\gamma_{\parallel},d\rightarrow0}\frac{\sigma}{d}=f\left(\frac{d}{\gamma_{\parallel}}\right),\label{eq:limit gamma parallel}

 of the Maxwell--Bloch equation linearized about a circulating mode, we
 have 
\begin_inset Formula $f(0)=\sigma_{1}$

 having a negative real part.
 The smallest positive zero 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{0}$

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re f$

 Hence, in the limit that both

 (some modification is required to handle the nonlinearity of the hole-burning

 However, we first force the degeneracy below threshold (repeating as needed
 as the pump strength is increased), so that both passive poles reach threshold
 simultaneously.
 (In practice, we achieved the fastest convergence by allowing passive poles
 to have positive imaginary parts, and then setting the pump strength so
 that the two poles

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}$

 (the nonlinearity in 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

, which in this case is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & q^{R} & q^{I}\\
0 & 1 & -q^{I} & q^{R}\\
\left(q^{R}\right)^{T} & -\left(q^{I}\right)^{T} & 0 & 0\\
\left(q^{I}\right)^{T} & \left(q^{R}\right)^{T} & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\delta\varepsilon^{R}\\
\delta\varepsilon^{I}\\
\lambda_{1}\\
\lambda_{2}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
0\\
0\\
\omega_{2}^{R}-\omega_{1}^{R}\\
\omega_{2}^{I}-\omega_{1}^{I}
\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here, the superscripts 
\begin_inset Formula $^{R}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $^{I}$
\end_inset

 denote real and imaginary parts, and we have defined 
\begin_inset Formula $q\equiv p_{2}-p_{1}$
\end_inset

, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 are Lagrange multipliers that are not needed.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

 is very close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

, we can improve the condition number of the matrix by freely multiplying
 the second-to-last row and column of the matrix by a constant factor, provided
 that the second-to-last element of the right-hand side is 
\emph on
divided 
\emph default
by the same factor.
 The same can be done for the last row and column, with the last element
 of the right-hand side.

Note that even after the thresholds and threshold frequencies have been
 made exactly degenerate using the QP procedure illustrated above, we are
 still in principle forcing the degeneracy.
 Above threshold, the delicate balance created by 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 to force the frequencies together is slightly broken.
 This results in an 
\emph on
approximate 
\emph default
degeneracy that is maintained very far above threshold, as shown in Fig.

\end_inset

, with only a 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-8}$
\end_inset

 splitting for pump strengths up to 100 times threshold.
 In practice, these results are already accurate enough to give all the
 desired physical information about the degenerate pair.
 If we wanted to be absolutely correct and force the degeneracy to machine
 precision (as it was in the exactly symmetric case for odd-
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 modes), we could simply perform QP again at some given 
\begin_inset Formula $d>0$
\end_inset

 to force 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\omega^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 back together.
 One extra caveat in this case is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\omega$
\end_inset

 is now a lasing pole, so the spatial hole-burning term need to be taken
 account for the perturbation theory (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\omega^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is still a passive pole, so the previous perturbation theory still applies),
 and instead of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:delta_omega_QP"

\end_inset

 we now have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\delta\omega & =-\frac{\int d^{3}x\,\mathbf{E}\cdot\left(\delta\varepsilon+\Dt\Gamma(\omega_{\mu})\delta H\right)\mathbf{E}}{\int d^{3}x\,\mathbf{E}\cdot\left(\frac{2\varepsilon}{\omega}+\frac{\partial\varepsilon}{\partial\omega}\right)\mathbf{E}}\nonumber \\
\varepsilon & \equiv\varepsilon_{c}+\Dt\Gamma(\omega)H\\
\delta H & \equiv\frac{1}{1+\left|\mathbf{E}+\delta\mathbf{E}\right|^{2}}-\frac{1}{1+\left|\mathbf{E}\right|^{2}}.\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta H$
\end_inset

 is the change in the spatial-hole burning term arising from the dielectric
 perturbation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 However, since there is no easy way to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathbf{E}$
\end_inset

 without numerically solving the full problem, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta H$
\end_inset

 is hard to determine semi-analytically.
 A simple work-around is to set 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta H=0$
\end_inset

 above, which makes this procedure no longer a true first-order perturbation
 theory.
 However, since the splitting is already so small as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:QP_stability"

\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 needed is also extremely small, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta H$
\end_inset

 is also negligible.
 Although 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\omega$
\end_inset

 is not zero to first order, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta H=0$
\end_inset

 approximation is enough to find a 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 that greatly decreases 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\omega$
\end_inset

.
 We find empirically that it usually takes one iteration of this above-threshold
 QP procedure to restore the degeneracy of the lasing pole 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and its passive mode 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 to machine precision, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\omega$
\end_inset

 is already very small.
 Practically speaking, this entire extra step is rarely needed since the
 solutions obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 for the linear problem below threshold are already close enough for most
 pump strengths of physical interest.
