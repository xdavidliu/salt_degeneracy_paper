We thank the referees for their helpful comments. The first referee brings up several perceived issues with our analysis, which we will address.

First, the referee questions the claim that the inversion oscillations average to zero if the beating frequencies (from the mode spacing) are much faster than the relaxation rate. This nontrivial result is the central assumption of the stationary-inversion approximation (SIA), and has been well-studied and used by multiple other authors, including in the original SALT paper (TuÌˆreci et. al. 2006 [ref. 8 in our manuscript]). There, the authors cite (Fu and Haken 1991 [ref. 26 in our manuscript]), who were the first to argue that the SIA is valid for multimode lasers. An analytical proof can also be found in (Haken 1985 [ref. 24 in our manuscript]) in Eq. 6.76 and Eq. 6.77 of that work, after which Haken directly states our claim: "the pulsations are negligible if the frequency distance of the laser modes is large compared to the inverse of the longitudinal relaxation time T of the inversion." A thorough quantitative verification of SALT and the SIA in the multimode regime was performed in (Ge et. al. 2008 [ref. 11 in our manuscript]) using full time-domain simulations of the original Maxwell--Bloch equations. We hope all of these references are sufficient to convince the reader that the SIA (which hinges on, and is equivalent to having the inversion oscillations average to zero) has been well-studied, and its regime of validity well-documented. To make it clearer that our assumption of SIA is nontrivial and based on previous work, we have slightly rearranged the placement of these references around the sentence in question in our manuscript, as well as added a short description of the result from (Haken 1985) that makes it clearer why having far-apart modes results in a stationary inversion.

The referee also mentions the need to separate the inversion into a slowly-varying term and terms oscillating at the beating frequencies. This is valid and can be done, but is not necessary in our case since it would simply result in an approximately stationary inversion. The point is that in the regime where the mode spacing is much larger than the inversion relaxation rate, the "slowly-varying term" would consequently not vary at all and stay fixed at a non-zero value, while the oscillating terms would still oscillate, but with such a small amplitude as to not have a noticeable effect on the overall inversion. In fact, Eq. 6.76 in (Haken 1985) specifically says that the ratio of the amplitude of these beating oscillations to the steady-state term is very small, provided that the beating is much faster than the relaxation rate.

Finally, the referee brings up the point that our analysis does not apply when two modes are closely-spaced but not exactly degenerate far above threshold. We do not dispute this: in fact, not only our analysis, but the entire SALT formalism would break down if this were to happen. This is why we have stated in multiple places in our manuscript the regime under which we are working (well-separated modes), which also is in fact an assumption that is made when non-degenerate SALT is used, and which can if necessary be checked for consistency, just as in non-degenerate SALT. For completeness, we now address the two ways that one might expect there to be closely-spaced modes far above threshold in the case of Cnv geometry. First, that a circulating lasing mode may split into two, for some reason. This is explicitly ruled out by the fact that the degeneracy persists exactly, without splitting, even above threshold (no matter how high, as long as the intensity pattern preserves Cn symmetry), which we have explained extensively in Sec. IV and Appendix A. Second, the possibility that a second degenerate pair may start lasing at some frequency far away from that of the first pair, but then converge towards the first pair as the pump strength is increased. We have found empirically that lasing frequencies even far above threshold don't change appreciably enough for this to happen. Additionally, even if it did, it would simply result in SALT breaking down (a regime that we have clearly stated we are not working in), and that possibility can easily be accounted for by monitoring the spacing between lasing frequencies just as in non-degenerate SALT; the presence of degeneracies does not require any extra precautions to be taken. For clarity, we have added short reminder in Sec. IV A. stating that when multiple pairs of modes are lasing, one technically needs to monitor the mode spacing to make sure stationary inversion is satisfied, just as in the case of non-degenerate lasers.

We hope that we have satisfactorily addressed the referee's concerns with our explanations and revisions, and as always, we welcome any further comments and suggestions.
