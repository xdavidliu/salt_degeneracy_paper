include Stephan's results in paper

re-insert deleted sentence on d and gamma_parallel dependence somewhere close to Stephan's results


However, when d
  is significantly large and \gamma_{\parallel}
  is significantly small, the exact eigenvalue \sigma
  associated with these below-threshold poles can become positive (even when SALT predicts that the pole remains below threshold), as seen in the example of the ring laser in Ref.Â [ref-rotter_degeneracy]. We assume henceforth that d
  is small enough that this effect does not happen.

How to convert from Lyx file to standalone tex file for submission to Phys Rev:

In lyx, export to "Latex (PDF Latex)", [ NOT "PDF (PDF Latex)" ]
then do "pdflatex degeneracy_paper" twice, followed by "bibtex degeneracy_paper"once, followed by the first command twice
Then do "cat degeneracy_paper.bbl | pbcopy" and then go into degeneracy_paper.teex, and at the very bottom, replace the line

\bibliography{references}

with the stuff on the clipboard, i.e. the contents of the .bbl file

UPDATE: Feb 6 paper accepted contingent on some minor revisions
- they want me to change \mathcal{O} to O in figs 6 and 9
 (there's a lot of mathcal{O}'s in the BODY too that they didn't mention
so I went ahead and changed those too)
The problem is that the pdf figures were made using a Matlab script, and 
I don't have Matlab anymore. The dialup.athena matlab is too slow over ssh,
so I used the one on Jdj. This is tricky, because the X window system
stopped working, and the -nojvm option doesn't allow creation of figures, so
I tweaked the source file for Fig6, resolution.m into resolutionB.m, then
uploaded it to jdj, ran matlab using the -nodesktop (not -nojvm!) option.

same thing with deps_scale.m and .pdf

(note the changes for the .m files were:
- first set fig to non-visibile so can plot without displaying window
- change \mathcal{O} to O, of course
- change last print statement to remove directory structure prefix
