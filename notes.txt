include Stephan's results in paper

re-insert deleted sentence on d and gamma_parallel dependence somewhere close to Stephan's results


However, when d
  is significantly large and \gamma_{\parallel}
  is significantly small, the exact eigenvalue \sigma
  associated with these below-threshold poles can become positive (even when SALT predicts that the pole remains below threshold), as seen in the example of the ring laser in Ref.Â [ref-rotter_degeneracy]. We assume henceforth that d
  is small enough that this effect does not happen.
