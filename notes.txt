Begin section with introduction
Cnv is group of n-fold rotations and mirror planes. You break the handedness and and you get Cn group, i.e. figure 2 right panel.

(first paragraph less technical, fewer equations; introduction)

main points want to make in this section:
if circulating mode lases, passive pole stays degenerate


section VI should be subsection of section V or two subsections of one section
(comine and write summary paragraph at the top)

For multimode section, move most of the stuff to the section on Cn, and the numerical trick to VI / V combined section.

if non-degenerate mode lases first, then |E|^2 is trivial representations because the characters are all +/-1, so absolute value is all +1 so trivial
(mention in concluding remarks)

split Appendix C into several subsections

introduction or conclusion
mention the moving of threshold to show counterexample of unstable circulating mode, but this is just an example of Cn

put numerical julia confirmation, plot omega1 and a's, in main paper.
