include Stephan's results in paper

re-insert deleted sentence on d and gamma_parallel dependence somewhere close to Stephan's results


However, when d
  is significantly large and \gamma_{\parallel}
  is significantly small, the exact eigenvalue \sigma
  associated with these below-threshold poles can become positive (even when SALT predicts that the pole remains below threshold), as seen in the example of the ring laser in Ref.Â [ref-rotter_degeneracy]. We assume henceforth that d
  is small enough that this effect does not happen.

How to convert from Lyx file to standalone tex file for submission to Phys Rev:

In lyx, export to "Latex (PDF Latex)", [ NOT "PDF (PDF Latex)" ]
then do "pdflatex degeneracy_paper" twice, followed by "bibtex degeneracy_paper"once, followed by the first command twice
Then do "cat degeneracy_paper.bbl | pbcopy" and then go into degeneracy_paper.teex, and at the very bottom, replace the line

\bibliography{references}

with the stuff on the clipboard, i.e. the contents of the .bbl file
